# TinyCalculator Abstract ℹ️
TinyCalculator is a simple C++ command-line program for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. Users select operations via a menu, input values, and receive results. The program tracks operation counts and displays a summary. It demonstrates OOP principles, control flow, and user input handling.

This project is a great starting point for anyone learning C++ and object-oriented programming concepts, as it demonstrates the use of classes, functions, loops, and switch statements. The program also includes user input handling and basic control flow mechanisms to ensure a smooth user experience. Future enhancements could include additional mathematical functions, improved input validation, and a graphical user interface for better accessibility.

# Usage ℹ️

**Run the Program**
Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

```
g++ -o TinyCalculator TinyCalculator.cpp
./TinyCalculator
```

Or run it directly in an IDE that supports C++.

**Select an Operation**
Upon launching, a menu appears with the following options:

- 1 → Addition (+)

- 2 → Subtraction (-)

- 3 → Multiplication (×)

- 4 → Division (÷)

- 5 → Modulo (%)

- 6 → Quit

**Input Values**

After selecting an operation, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers.

**View Results**

The result is displayed on the screen. The user is then asked if they want to perform another calculation (y/n).

**Exit and Summary**

If the user selects n, the program exits and displays the total count of each operation performed.
